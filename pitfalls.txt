Macros Pitfalls
#define SQR(x) x*x
Operator Precedence Errors: SQR(a + b); is expanded to: a + b*a + band not: (a + b)*(a + b)Solution :Put parentheses (or braces) around Macro#define SQR(x) ((x) * (x))
Side Effects Errors: SQR(i++);expanded to: i++ * i++which increments i twice.
Unnecessary Function Calls: SQR(long_function(a,b,c));will evaluate the function twice.
There are no general solutions for the last two errors - so be cautious and wise !


#include <stdio.h>
#define MULTIPLY(a, b) a*b
int main()
{
    // The macro is expanded as 2 + 3 * 3 + 5, not as 5*8
    printf("%d", MULTIPLY(2+3, 3+5));
    return 0;
}
// Output: 16


include <stdio.h>
//here, instead of writing a*a we write (a)*(b)
#define MULTIPLY(a, b) (a)*(b)
int main()
{
    // The macro is expanded as (2 + 3) * (3 + 5), as 5*8
    printf("%d", MULTIPLY(2+3, 3+5));
    return 0;
}
